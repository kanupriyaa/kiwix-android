* UI as a full-screen dialog (as per material design guidelines)
* DONE: Need to discuss back-end implementation
	- Separate note for each wiki article
	- {Primary External Storage}/Kiwix/Notes/WikiName/ArticleName.txt

Implementation:
- Initially focus on creating necessary path directory and saving
- For changed file, ask user confirmation before closing on dismiss
- Disable save button for empty note files (as per Material Design)?
- Use MD guidelines for visual appearance and spacing
- FIXED: Material Design says use only one confirmation action on top right - Shift 'Share' to content area
	> Two buttons isn't a violation. Eg: Reddit
