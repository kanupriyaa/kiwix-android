* UI as a full-screen dialog (as per material design guidelines)
* Need to discuss back-end implementation

Implementation:
- For changed file, ask user confirmation before closing on dismiss
- Disable save button for empty note files (as per Material Design)?
- Material Design says use only one confirmation action on top right - Shift 'Share' to content area
- Use MD guidelines for visual appearance and spacing
