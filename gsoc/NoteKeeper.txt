* UI as a full-screen dialog (as per material design guidelines)
* DONE: Need to discuss back-end implementation
	- Separate note for each wiki article
	- {External Storage}/Kiwix/Notes/WikiName/ArticleName.txt

Steps:
1) DONE: Create a public directory in external storage and save file
2) DONE: Modify code to create path/directories as per: {External Storage}/Kiwix/Notes/WikiName/ArticleName.txt
3) DONE: Code for reading file if it exists in the said directory (when AddNoteDialog opens)
4) Finally,
	- For changed file, ask user confirmation before closing on dismiss
	- DONE: Disable save until note edited
	- Share functionality: App chooser for sharing note
	- Disable buttons for empty note files


Implementation:
- Initially focus on creating necessary path directory and saving

	When opening note only look for readablility (writability if doesn't exist)
	When saving, then ask for writability and inform user if don't get it

- For changed file, ask user confirmation before closing on dismiss
- Disable save button for empty note files (as per Material Design)?
- Use MD guidelines for visual appearance and spacing
- FIXED: Material Design says use only one confirmation action on top right - Shift 'Share' to content area
	> Two buttons isn't a violation. Eg: Reddit


Testing:
- Across multiple books, articles, tabs
- Configuration change
